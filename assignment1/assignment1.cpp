	Question 3

	a) A recursive function is tail recursive when recursive call is the last thing executed by the function. 
  It is considered better than non tail recursive functions as it can be optimized by compiler. The idea used 
  by compilers to optimize tail-recursive functions is simple: since the recursive call is the last statement, 
  there is nothing left to do in the current function, so no need to save current functionâ€™s stack frame. 
  
  For example below is a tail-recursion implemented for calculating factorial:
  int sum = 0;
  int sum(x, sum)  
  {
    if (x==0) return sum;
    else return sum(x-1, sum+x);
  }
    sum(5,0)
  = sum(4,5)
  = sum(3,9)
  = sum(2,12)
  = sum(1,14)
  = sum(0,15)
  = 15

  Had it not been tail-recursive, it would re-call the returned value every single time:
  int sum(x) 
  {
    if (x==1) return x;
    else return (x + sum(x-1));
  }
    sum(5)
  = 5 + sum(4)
  = 5 + 4 + sum(3)
  = 5 + 4 + 3 + sum(2)
  = 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + sum(1)
  = 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1
  = 15

  b) Consider the function to calculate factorial of n. It is non-tail-recursive. By code inspection, we can see 
  the value returned by fact(n-1) is used in fact(n), so the call to fact(n-1) is not the last thing done by fact(n)

  #include<iostream>
  using namespace std; 

  // A NON-tail-recursive function. The function is not tail 
  // recursive because the value returned by fact(n-1) is used in 
  // fact(n) and call to fact(n-1) is not the last thing done by fact(n) 
  
  unsigned int fact(unsigned int n) 
  { 
    if (n == 0) return 1; 
    return n*fact(n-1); 
  } 
  // Driver program to test above function 
  int main() 
  { 
    cout << fact(5); 
    return 0; 
  } 

  The above function can be written as a tail recursive function. The idea is to use one more argument and 
  accumulate the factorial value in second argument. When n reaches 0, return the accumulated value.

  However, if the number of substeps produced at each step is more than 1 (substantially recursive), tail 
  recursion cannot be done. To implement such an algorithm tail-recursively, additional storage would be 
  required to store pending sub-problems. An example of this is tree traversal, whereby each parent might 
  have 2 or more children. Such a recursive algorithm would not be able to be implemented tail recursively.
